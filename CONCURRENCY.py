# Getting the most out of your software is something all developers strive for, and concurrency, 
# and the art of concurrent programming, happens to be one of the best ways in order for you to 
# improve the performance of your applications. 

# Gone are the days of unresponsive programs that give you no indication as to whether theyâ€™ve 
# crashed or are still silently working.

# By choosing to implement systems in a concurrent fashion, we typically see an increase in the
# overall complexity of our code, and a heightened risk for bugs to appear within this new code.
